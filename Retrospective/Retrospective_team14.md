## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done : 3 vs. 0
- Total points committed vs. done : 18 vs. 0
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 59 vs. 48

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    8    |        |    38      |     28       |       (Task #10 Integretion test not done)
| _#1_   |    2    |   13   |    6       |     8        |
| _#2_   |    2    |   2    |    5       |     4        |
| _#3_   |    3    |   3    |    10      |     8        |



- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual) : estimate task average: 3.9 , actual task average: 3.2 , standard deviation : 1.6
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 : 0.23

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 9
  - Total hours spent : 10
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 10
  - Coverage (if available) : n/a
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4
  - Total hours spent: 0
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 3 
  - Total hours spent : 4
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? Lack of experience in project planning, some difficulties in the organization of the teamwork

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? Better knowledge about team members, bad team organization and enviroment use (Github branch management issue)

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? n/a 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? n/a

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.) :

  > branch management : doing internet research, discussing with team members during planning
  > integration test : searching documentation, diving deep in the framework

- One thing you are proud of as a Team: responsability of each team member and comunication
